1. Using jQuery:
//can download external file or use CDN
//use jquery CDN to ensure already stored in user's browser
//downside - relying on 3rd party to have active servers
//Zenva - hosts own jquery files

//include jQuery in script tag - use compressed for production, uncompressed for development

2. jQuery Documentation - getting familiar with its API
//https://api.jquery.com/ - will show what is deprecated or in use
//jqapi.com - presents same content in more visually organized way
//learn.jquery.com - jquery supported site
